<p>Alex and I met at <a href="http://www.fcc.edu/" class="attr">Florida Christian College</a> in October of 2011. I was hanging out with a friend, and Alex stopped by and introduced himself. We have not stop talking to each other from that moment.</p>
			<p>He asked me out the following week! Our conversations just flowed. We loved getting to know each other. We knew that we were good together. We enjoyed so many of the same things like art, music, Disney, going on adventures, and exploring new places!</p></div>
