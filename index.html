			<p>Alex and I met at <a href="http://www.fcc.edu/" class="attr">Florida Christian College</a> in October of 2011. I was hanging out with a friend, and Alex stopped by and introduced himself. We have not stop talking to each other from that moment.</p>
			<p>He asked me out the following week! Our conversations just flowed. We loved getting to know each other. We knew that we were good together. We enjoyed so many of the same things like art, music, Disney, going on adventures, and exploring new places!</p>

			<p>About a year later, we began talking about marriage and if it was the right choice to make. We knew that we loved each other, and would never stop. We wanted to bear the image of Christ and His church. We began dreaming and praying for this big decision; it was such a peaceful, easy decision to make.</p>
			<p>So, Alex went to my dad and asked for my hand in marriage. "Which hand?!" My dad replied. He, of course, said yes, and gave Alex my grandmother's engagement ring.</p>

			<div class="twocol">
			<p>June 29th 2013- Alex picked me up in morning for a full day at Disney. He was acting a little odd all morning. Alex kept texting a girl from high school, whom he was planning on us meeting later on that day for lunch (She turned out to be our photographer). We got in the Magic Kingdom and he handed me a sweet little envelope with a riddle inside telling me to go to a different part of the park and there I would get another letter! So I went on this little scavenger hunt and he said that the last one would lead us to where we were going to have dinner. He had his camera bag on all day and he finally took his camera out to start taking some pictures. We walked to the rose garden in front of the castle, and he handed me another letter.</p></div>

			<p>He bent down to "change his lens" while I was reading the letter. I realized what was happening when I was reading the letter, and I looked away and there he was down on one knee, holding a beautiful ring. He said all sorts of sweet and beautiful things, and asked me if I would marry him! I was in shock! I said <strong>yes</strong>! Then I noticed the "friend from high school" over behind a tree taking pictures. We posed for a few pictures and then he handed me the last letter. It was telling me that our families and best friends were going to meet us at the Grand Floridian Hotel for dinner in just a few hours!</p>
